    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Arborio rice</li>
      <li>4 cups chicken or vegetable broth</li>
      <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp saffron threads, soaked in 2 tbsp warm water</li>
      <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened and translucent, about 4-5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add the Arborio rice to the pot and stir to coat the grains with butter. Cook for about 2 minutes until the rice is lightly toasted.</li>
      <li>Pour in the white wine and cook until the wine is mostly absorbed by the rice.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, in a separate pot, bring the broth to a simmer over low heat. Keep the broth warm while making the risotto.</li>
      <li>Begin adding the warm broth to the rice, one ladleful at a time, stirring frequently. Wait until the liquid is mostly absorbed before adding more broth. Continue this process until the rice is creamy and cooked through, about 18-20 minutes.</li>
      <li>Once the rice is tender and creamy, stir in the saffron with its soaking water, Parmesan cheese, and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
      <li>Remove the risotto from heat and let it rest for a couple of minutes before serving. Serve hot, garnished with additional Parmesan if desired.</li>
    </ol>
